###### BUILD DEPENDENCYâ€™S 

the following packages are needed to build Gx4BandEQ:

- libc6-dev

- x11proto-dev

note that those packages could have different, but similar names 
on different distributions. There is no configure script, 
make will simply fail when one of those packages isn't found.
